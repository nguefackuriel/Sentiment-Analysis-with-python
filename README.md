# Sentiment-Analysis-with-python

The aim of this project is to perform a sentiment analysis using data scrapped from twitter about the National President Elections in Nigeria in 2023.

We perform data cleaning by removing:
* mentions/userhandles
* hashtags
* urls
* emojis
* special char

We used the librairy Textblob to get the sentiment and also wordcloud to visualize
